## Usage

The `fir_api` plugin allows you to interact with FIR programmatically.

This plugin is mandatory and therefore is enabled by default.

The API is pretty much self documented in the dedicated web interface available at `http(s)://YOURFIRINSTALL/api/`.

### Authentication

You need to be authenticated in order to use the API.
It will accept session or token based authentication.
Tokens can be retrieved from your user profile (`http(s)://YOURFIRINSTALL/user/profile`) and should be specified as a request header.
Example:

```
X-Api: Token 9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b
```

### Querying the API

The APIs endpoints are all documented at `http(s)://YOURFIRINSTALL/api/`. 

As example, here is how to add a comment to an incident via API, using different languages/tools:

Python:
```
import requests
requests.post("http(s)://YOURFIRINSTALL/api/comments", headers={"X-API": "Token 9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b"}, json={"comment": "This is a comment made via API", "incident": 1, "action": "Info"}).json()
```

curl:
```
curl http(s)://YOURFIRINSTALL/api/comments -H "X-API: Token 9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"comment": "This is a comment made via API", "incident": 1, "action": "Info"}'
```

powershell:
```
Invoke-RestMethod http(s)://YOURFIRINSTALL/api/comments  -Method 'Post' -Headers @{"X-API"="Token 9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b"} -Body @{"comment"="This is a comment made via API"; "incident"="1"; "action"="Info"}
```
